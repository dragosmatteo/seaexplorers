## About Us

Making money and helping the sea together
Sea Explorers is a collection of 3033 unique explorers stored on the Elrond blockchain, together we try to save the ocean and find the treasure hidden in the depths. All explorers have unique utilities and can help in the process of cleaning the ocean.

All the action takes place on the seabed developing and helping the marine ecosystem, we are a community of explorers which you can enter by buying an nft, we try to develop and save the ocean together by our actions.
